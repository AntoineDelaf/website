title: Test of the pressure hull at 255 m depth in Toulon
date: 01/07/2016

A major milestone was reached on Friday July 1st. 
Without anyone inside, the pressure resistant hull was lowered in the sea down to more than 250 meters water depth, for one hour.
With the help of the Coquimar boat, and acceptance from authorities despite our late request.
The result: no implosion, no leak. This test was key to validate the design and fabrication of the hull. 
It will allow us to dive down to 100 meters water depth in serenity.
