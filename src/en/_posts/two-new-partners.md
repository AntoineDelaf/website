The marine station of Dinard of the Museum national d'histoire Naturelle and its director Eric Feunteun, have proposed their help to plan the scientific programme.

All this is on our [Partners](partners.html) page, where you will also enjoy, if you have not seen the video yet, watching Paul Moorhouse and John Ramsay, our partners in Plymouth, talking about the many subs they have worked on.
