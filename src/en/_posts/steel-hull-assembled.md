This week, we went to Emile van Essen in Amsterdam to check out the brand new hull of our sub.
Emile did an incredible work. 
Paul Moorhouse, the designer of the sub was here too, as well as Charles Balsan representing our partner Wendel Participations. 
We had a couple of work sessions about the next steps of the design. 
Great and productive days.
For the first time, we could get a feel for the available living space in the sub 
and successfully test switching seats between the pilot and pedaller seats.

At the end, we even got to do a little dive in Emile's own sub. video [here](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Projet-Poisson-Pilote-Pilot-Fish-Project/294329844027226)
