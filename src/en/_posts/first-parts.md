They do not look like much yet, 
but these pieces of metal will soon be the extremities of the pressure resistant hull of the future Pilot Fish submarine:

Hot pressed, with a diameter of 1m and thickness around 1cm, 
they will be welded to the 2.5m long main cylindrical part of the hull. 
The whole thing will only give just over 2 cubic meters of space to the pilots and all the equipment for a week!
