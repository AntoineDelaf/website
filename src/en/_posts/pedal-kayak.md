As a complement to regular cyling, here is a good way we found for the physical prep! 
The position and level of effort (100-150W) are comparable to those inside the sub.
Plus, time flies on this little boat: we have already pedaled non stop for a full day with no issue.

You can check the detail of the drive train [here](http://www.hobiecat.com/mirage/miragedrive/). 
To answer the obvious question in advance: yes the mechanism is perfect for a kayak, 
but too complex unfortunately to find its place on a water tight submarine.
