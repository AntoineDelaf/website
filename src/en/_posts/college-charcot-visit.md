This Friday, I could come back to the Collège Charcot in Saint Malo, and meet again the students of the 3e option physique class. 
The objective was to give some news of the project, and also to tell them how the basic laws of physics could have an influence 
on the design of the sub its size, speed, pedalling strategy, features. 
I talked a bit too long, so I need to come back to give more time to exchange.
