###01/07/2016 - Test of the pressure hull at 255 m depth in Toulon

A major milestone was reached on Friday July 1st. 
Without anyone inside, the pressure resistant hull was lowered in the sea down to more than 250 meters water depth, for one hour.
With the help of the Coquimar boat, and acceptance from authorities despite our late request.
The result: no implosion, no leak. This test was key to validate the design and fabrication of the hull. 
It will allow us to dive down to 100 meters water depth in serenity.

###31/05/2016 - Validation of the submarine's performances after a new series of tests in Biscarosse

On May 15th we performed a another set of tests at Biscarosse, staying nearly 24 hours in the submarine.
We could check our cruising speed, in line with expectations. Going down to 10 meters water depth, 
we could also test the behavior of the submarine and its piloting.

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

###01/04/2016 - Launching of the submarine in SW France at Biscarosse in the Cazaux-Sanguinet lake

![](../images/crew.jpg)

After some intense days of preparation the big moment arrives with the launching of the sub and the first shallow dives, with TV crews filming.
Hopefully it all goes well.

###14/12/2015 - Presentation of the Submarine at the Paris International Nautic Show 

The composite shell being finished, after an exhibition at our sponsor Total early December, 
we got the opportunity to present the sub at the Nautic in Paris, with lots of visits, positive contacts, 
and some articles in the local press and radio.

###07/06/2015 - drive train tests

Here are the forward and aft drive pedal sets. We tested it this week end, 
there are only a cm or two between our feet and the hull.

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

###17/03/2015 - Some news of the project

Our facebook page gets all the updates and our website had not been updated for a while. 
So here is the sub as it is today. Not quite finished. Inside, we will install the drive train and all piping next month.

###28/02/2015 - Visit at Collège Charcot in Saint-Malo

This Friday, I could come back to the Collège Charcot in Saint Malo, and meet again the students of the 3e option physique class. 
The objective was to give some news of the project, and also to tell them how the basic laws of physics could have an influence 
on the design of the sub its size, speed, pedalling strategy, features. 
I talked a bit too long, so I need to come back to give more time to exchange.

###09/04/2014 - The Expedition and Submarine Pages updated

Notably with more inspiring new pictures!

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

###09/04/2014 - The steel hull assembled

This week, we went to Emile van Essen in Amsterdam to check out the brand new hull of our sub.
Emile did an incredible work. 
Paul Moorhouse, the designer of the sub was here too, as well as Charles Balsan representing our partner Wendel Participations. 
We had a couple of work sessions about the next steps of the design. 
Great and productive days.
For the first time, we could get a feel for the available living space in the sub 
and successfully test switching seats between the pilot and pedaller seats.

At the end, we even got to do a little dive in Emile's own sub. video [here](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Projet-Poisson-Pilote-Pilot-Fish-Project/294329844027226)

###23/03/2014 - Some pics of the fabrication

You will have recognized the main hull cylinder, the area around the hatch, 
and the acrylic sheets, one of which will be pressed into the transparent dome.

###2/03/2014 - Here is the thing

![](../images/SubNew.jpg)

The final color has yet to be decided.

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

###12/02/2014 - The first parts of the submarine!

They do not look like much yet, 
but these pieces of metal will soon be the extremities of the pressure resistant hull of the future Pilot Fish submarine:

![](../images/DISH1.jpg)

![](../images/DISH2.jpg)

Hot pressed, with a diameter of 1m and thickness around 1cm, 
they will be welded to the 2.5m long main cylindrical part of the hull. 
The whole thing will only give just over 2 cubic meters of space to the pilots and all the equipment for a week!

###13/01/2014 - A new page on the website

As we were starting to be submerged with press articles -in French so far- about the project, 
we thought we should list them under a new page [On en parle](http://www.projetpoissonpilote.com/onenparle.html).

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

###08/01/2014 - A pedal kayak for the physical training

As a complement to regular cyling, here is a good way we found for the physical prep! 
The position and level of effort (100-150W) are comparable to those inside the sub.
Plus, time flies on this little boat: we have already pedaled non stop for a full day with no issue.

![](../images/kayak.jpg)

You can check the detail of the drive train [here](http://www.hobiecat.com/mirage/miragedrive/). 
To answer the obvious question in advance: yes the mechanism is perfect for a kayak, 
but too complex unfortunately to find its place on a water tight submarine.

###05/01/2014 - The challenge of building a sub in video

[Here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBrt3sC6YcA) is the thrilling story of the Alicia submersible, built in Plymouth ten years ago.
You will notice that the Pilot Fish Project is not the first challenge taken on by Paul, Alicia's designer!

###13/12/2013 - The steel hull

It will be built in the Nederlands under the supervision of [AiResearch](http://www.airesearch.nl) and Emile Van Essen, 
who already have 3 subs on their belt.

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

###6/12/2013 - The project gets the 2013 Family Initiative Award from Wendel-Participations

We are pleased and thankful to welcome a new sponsor: Wendel Participations, 
a family holding company whose history started over 300 years ago in an eastern France foundry. 
Now a long term investor, the group values spirit of entreprise, search for performance and responsibility.
Three values our project has in the cross hairs!

###6/12/2013 - A presentation of the project to the students of the Collège Charcot of Saint-Malo

followed by a series of questions, bringing smiles as much as seriously technical answers: 

What are you going to eat in the sub?

How will you be clothed?

We will come back to this, these seemingly benign subjects actually led us 
to dig up some scientific litterature about space flight and astronauts suits.

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

###26/07/2013 - A new partner, The Institut Océanographique of Monaco

The Maison des Océans in Paris and the Musée océanographique of Monaco will help us
share our adventure and its results with the public.

###20/05/2013 - A word from the godfather of the project

For those who do not know who Mr Minster is, here is his [bio](http://ec.europa.eu/research/eurab/cvminster.html)

For French readers, here is a small word of support from him:

<span style="font-style: italic;">Comme l'avouent avec jubilation ses inventeurs, Antoine Delafargue et Michael de Lagarde, 
ce projet de traversée de la Manche en sous-marin à pédale est un peu fou. 
Pourtant, il est étudié avec une grande rigueur : posez leur une question sur la conception du sous-marin, 
la navigation, les aléas de la Manche, la gestion de la sécurité, les risques de santé, 
les applications scientifiques ou la communication, et ils vous exposeront leur analyse. 
Interrogez les sur les partenaires, industriels, de vulgarisation scientifique, 
et ils vous présenteront leurs démarches.</span>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Devant un projet à la fois si fou et si construit, 
je ne pouvais que leur apporter mon soutien. Aidez-les, ils le méritent.</span>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Jean-François Minster</span>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">

###25/04/2013 - Two new partners

The marine station of Dinard of the Museum national d'histoire Naturelle and its director Eric Feunteun,
have proposed their help to plan the scientific programme.

In an entirely different domain, Manu Métal proposes their expertise for specific metallic works.

All this is on our <a href="partners.html">Partners</a> page, where you will also enjoy, if you have not seen the video yet, 
watching Paul Moorhouse and John Ramsay, our partners in Plymouth, talking about the many subs they have worked on.
